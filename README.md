# bpc-pc2t-projekt

All commits/tags/etc have been added by either `vut-dgacek` or `user <user@localhost>`.
For git stuff I'm using `cygwin` with `git` installed.
I don't know why but sometimes tags added by `user` are showing up as if they were added by someone else.

**I'm using LibericaJDK-17 since that was already installed on my system. So if there is any incompatibilty that's why.**
**I hope the program doesn't break when encountering non-english chars**
